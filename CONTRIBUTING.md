# Contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an [issue already exists]((https://github.com/Brinfer/LaTeX-template/issues)). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Brinfer/LaTeX-template/issues/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Brinfer/LaTeX-template/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make change

#### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Be careful to respect the project standards. Use the [githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) provided to help you meet them. To use them, use this command line:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

#### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
