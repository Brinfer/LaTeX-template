    name={sherpa},
    description={Sherpa originally meant the tribe in Nepal whose social custom was to provide humane and courageous
            mountain guides to outsiders. This tribe didn't use last names, so they were all referred to as Sherpas.
            To the Sherpa, all Himalayan peaks are sacred, so every tour holds ethical and religious meaning. Westerners
            picked up on this and use Sherpa to mean an assistant who knows more than the boss.}
